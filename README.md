# odin-landing-page
Landing Page project from The Odin Project's Foundation course.

I added my own pictures of my cat to replace the placeholder blocks from the design document as well as rewrote the placeholder text but the design is more or less unchanged from the design document. This took a little more time than I expected, but was a good reinforcement of the tutorials and a good demonstration that just having read how to do something doesn't necessarily mean I actually can.
